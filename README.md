Simple hipchat helper plugin for pidign.

Currently this plugin just does a html decode for all messages comming from
the hipchat servers. This avoids double encoded messages from plugins like
the Jenkins or Github plugin.

Just place this in your $HOME/.purple/plugins directory and enable the plugin.
